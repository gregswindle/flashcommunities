# `flash-communities`
> :children_crossing: An art collective dedicated to generating spontaneous events designed to inspire a sense of humanistic unity among strangers.

## Epic story: facilitate flash-communities

As a Humanist,<br>
I want to facilitate rapid communal bounds using personal, data-mined sounds and imagery<br>
In order to inspire spontaneous social unity among strangers.<br>

## Background

Unlike flashmobs -- quick, public assemblies of people who engage in coordinated _performances_ intended for outward-facing audiences -- flash-communities are more _inward-facing_ events akin to family reunions, where members share a pot-luck of music, tweets, posts, videos, and images (all of which are anonymously and automatically data-mined from mobile devices).

### Example via an initial art installation

> #### :information_source: Prerequisite data-mining
>
> As currently conceived, flash-communities will require a mobile app that participants must install and (transparently) link to their social media accounts. The mobile app anonymously gathers (and classifies?) favorite
> * songs,
> * recent images, and
> other personal data/media
>
> These data are then structured in a NoSQL backend for coordinated presentations of meaningful life-events and facts to be shared and orchestrated during a flash-community event.

#### Technology overview

- [ ] Mobile app that mines social media audio-visual likes
- [ ] BaaS to store data
- [ ] Async backend agents that classify the media:
   - [ ] Chronologically
   - [ ] Geo-spatially
   - [ ] Music by
      - [ ] Genre
      - [ ] Key
      - [ ] ...
- [ ] Data-store, backend APIs, etc.

#### Flash-community event

> :iphone: As currently conceived, flash-communities will require a mobile app that participants must install and (transparently) link to their social media accounts. The mobile app anonymously gathers favorite songs, recent images, and other personal data in order to generate a coordinated presentation of meaningful life-events and facts to be shared and orchestrated during a flash-community event.

Participants enter a room (inspired/informed by the work of Olafur Eliasson) and:

- [ ] 1. Beacons identify participants and queue their prepared media
- [ ] 2. Images begin to float from the floor to the ceiling, moving upward in chronological order
- [ ] 3. Intersections, unions, and associations among participants' data are sonically accentuated with reverb to create tones and chords
- [ ] 4. All media and song merge harmonically overhead to generate a unique "noosphere"


## Next steps

- [ ] Story-board a "best case" example
- [ ] Design the data store and its associations
- [ ] Map audio and visuals (preferably in Key)
- [ ] Identify and design visual surfaces that reflect or project images
- [ ] Budget the whole damn thing :money_with_wings:

### Reduce and refine scope

- Based on feasibility and resources, determine whether to proceed.
- Gather materials for a prototype
- Build app and backend
- Conduct tests

### Design solid privacy protection

Privacy is paramount, and I will not proceed unless I feel confident about a data store and security risks.

Participants should be able to choose what *not* to be shared.
